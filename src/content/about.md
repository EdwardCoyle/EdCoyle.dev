# About

Hi, I'm Ed Coyle.  I make nifty things on the web, and elsewhere!

I'm currently a Senior Front End Engineer for [Infor's Hook & Loop division](https://hookandloop.design/).  I also do freelance web design and development for projects that I find interesting, challenging, and exciting.  I occasionally work on illustrations, graphic design, and animation for games as a team member of [The Games Page](http://www.thegamespage.com).

Some of my hobbies in the real world space include drawing and sketching, tinkering with electronics and woodworking, running through all kinds of terrain, and growing food in my garden.  I've also been known to throw down in games of darts, horseshoes, and Super Smash Bros.  I'm inspired by a solid craft beer, spending time with lifelong friends, and of course, my talented wife Michelle and our kids, AJ and Sam.

I'm always interested in connecting with new people and learning about new opportunities. Please [contact me](mailto:edcoyle86@gmail.com) if you'd like to work with me on something amazing!
