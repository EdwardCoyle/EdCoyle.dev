# Projects

My career has been exciting and diverse!  Here are some projects I've helped to develop or animate.

## Infor Design System - Enterprise Components

Built for: [Infor Hook & Loop](https://hookandloop.design)
Built with: Javascript, Typescript, SASS, HTML, Node.js

I work as a Senior Developer on the IDS Enterprise Components team.  My colleagues and I made a great effort in the last few years to open source [Infor's component library](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise), which is used by many of the company's web applications.

In addition to the work on the front end, I also frequently work on the developer experience and the build system for the components, which allows custom bundles and provides an API for "on the fly" compilations of the components.

## Games @ The Games Page

Built for: [The Games Page](http://thegamespage.com)

I've been a part of The Games Page for many years, working with [Gary Gasko]() to build fun games for Windows Desktop, and eventually the web.  I've been responsible for artwork, animations, level design, and maybe some code snippets here and there, found in many of Gary's games.  As of 2019, we still have game projects in development, and hope to have some amazing web games out for people to enjoy in the near future.
